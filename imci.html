			<h2>Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI)</h2>
			<p>As a part of my study abroad experience in Cape Town, South Africa for a Global Healthcare Technologies program, I designed an Android application that facilitates an independent learning experience for practicing nurses.</p>

			<p>This project was my first look into the world of user interface design. It was a pivotal experience that led to my decision to pursue a career in user experience design!</p>

			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>Every day, millions of children in developing countries are not properly assessed and treated despite the plethora of healthcare infrustructures and providers: hospitals, health centers, pharamacists, doctors, and even traditional healers. Health facilities in low-income countries lack diagnostic supports such as radiology and laboratory services, drugs and equipment, and standardized clinical procedures due to irregular flows of patients.</p>

			<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) have partnered to address this challenge by developing a strategy called the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). It is an integrated approach to children's health that focuses on the well-being of the whole child rather than on a single condition. While the strategy has been firmly established, introducing and implementing IMCI is a process and a challenge in itself. It involves a great deal of coordination among existing programs and services as well as education and training of standard IMCI clinical guidelines.</p>

			</br>

			<h2>Mission</h2>
			<p>My team of four classmates was tasked with investigating the formal instruction of IMCI in nursing programs and creating an Android learning application that will not only optimize the learning process for students but also alleviate the teaching responsibilities of professors. This tool will allow medical personnel to practice assessing and classifying sick children and ultimately to apply the knowledge in clinical settings.</p>

			</br>

			<h2>Current Method of Instruction</h2>
			<p>Over the course of a 4-week long curriculum, students at the Western Cape College of Nursing are currently learning IMCI practices primarily through a paper-based exercise handbook with accompanying videos and photos for relevant case studies. Classrooms consist of 80 students to one instructor which makes instructional guidance quite difficult.</p>

			<p>Below, I map out the user flow for the current student learning experience (in blue) in conjunction with the instructor's role in the process (in green). Students submit their handbooks for grading after four weeks as shown.</p>

			</br></br>
			<div class="three-thirds"><img src="img/imci/IMCI_User-Flow.png" alt="IMCI User Flow"></div>

			<p>Below is a sample exercise for students to practice assessing medical symptoms:</p>
			</br>
			<div class="three-thirds"><img src="img/imci/IMCI_Exercise.png" alt="IMCI Handbook Exercise"></div>			

			</br></br>

			<h2>Reenvisioning the Learning Experience</h2>
			<p>Upon conducting a complete content audit of the existing IMCI handbook, my team and I found that the educational content is fairly organized and regimented into various learning modules. As such, we imagine that our proposed IMCI application can mirror the existing curriculum as shown below. 

			</br></br>
			<div class="three-thirds"><img src="img/imci/IMCI_User-Flow-App.png" alt="IMCI App User Flow"></div>

			</br>

			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>Upon meeting with the client and conducting interviews with practicing nurses as well as nurses in training at the Western Cape College of Nursing, my team and I determined the following design requirements for the IMCI application:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><u>Holistic Learning Materials</u>
				<p>The principal requirement for this app is to faithfully recreate the paper exercise book into an electronic medium. This would consist of direct transcription of the exercises, as well as any corresponding videos, photos, and flowcharts necessary for completion of the exercises.</p></li></br>
				<li><u>Self-Guided Learning</u>
				<p>We want to alleviate the concerns of learning IMCI in a large classroom setting. Students must be able to learn the content themselves with minimal external guidance.</p></li></br>
				<li><u>Streamlined Communication</u>
				<p>In current IMCI courses, students and the instructor do not have a means of communication outside of the classroom. This app must provide a platform for student-instructor and peer-peer conversations for an interactive and engaging learning experience.</p></li></br>
				<li><u>Portability</u>
				<p>We want students to be able to use this app whenever and wherever--in their residence, in clinics, and even on public transportation. They can forgo their heavy IMCI handbook and supplementary learning materials.</p></li></br>
				<li><u>Ease of Use</u>
				<p>We want to appeal to all students learning IMCI, regardless of their technical training or expertise. Making the app simple to navigate and intuitive to use allows the app to reach a broad audience while also upholding Android UI design principles.</p></li>	
			</ul>

			<p></p>

			</br>

			<h2>Our Solution</h2>
			<p>Using <a href="http://www.justinmind.com/" target="_blank">JustInMind</a>, we created a prototype of the IMCI learning application, which is fundamentally an electronic version of the IMCI handbook. It contains the various educational modules and the associated exercises that are included in the physical. Accordingly, there are case studies and photo/video exercises, and the user is prompted to answer multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and free-response types of questions.</p>

			<p>But the app is more than just the exercise book, and includes other useful features that allow the user to have a convenient and intuitive independent learning experience. These features include a discussion board to converse with the instructor and peers, a submission function to submit answers to the instructor for comments, a feedback system to provide immediate results and solutions, a "flagging" function to bookmark difficult questions, accessibility to reference flowcharts while completing exercises, multi-language options for text display and text-to-speech, and progress bars to indicate completion progress of the six modules. The next section outlines some of these features in further detail.</p>

			<p><b>Please note that these wireframes are low-fidelity and are intended moreso for concept ideation and direction than for intuitive interaction design.</b></p>

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<p>Given that the user may not have significant experience with technology, it is crucial that the flow of screens are organized to provide an intuitive and streamlined navigation experience. Adhering to <a href="https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation-drawer.html" target="_blank">Android UI standards</a>, this application includes an action bar that displays the title of the current page, and a navigation drawer that transitions in from the left edge of the screen and displays the app's main functions. The user can access the navigation drawer by touching the app icon on the left edge of the action bar or swiping from the left edge of anywhere on the screen.</p>

			<p>The navigation drawer allows users to jump to a specific exercise in a specific module from any screen. Modules and exercises are organized in sub-levels that stem from the top-level exercise book.</p>

			</br></br>
			<div class="one-thirds centered"><img src="img/imci/IMCI_Navigation.png" alt="IMCI App Navigation"></div>

			</br>

			<h3>Educational Modules</h3>
			<p>Flexible navigation through the app ensures that students can complete modules and exercises at their will, rather than through a strict sequence. In this fashion, progress is not as predictable, but we have remedied this issue by implementing a progress bar beneath each module. This will indicate the completion status of modules so that students can keep track of their progress as they seek to fulfill deadlines placed by their instructor.</p>

			</br></br>
			<div class="one-thirds centered"><img src="img/imci/IMCI_Educational-Modules.png" alt="IMCI Exercise Book Modules"></div>

			</br>

			<h3>Text Display / Text-to-Speech</h3>
			<p>The text displayed in the app will ideally be a transcription of the current IMCI exercise book, which is in English. Despite IMCI instruction being performed in English, there is still the possibility of language barriers given the multitude of languages spoken in South Africa, such as English, Afrikaans, and Xhosa. Thus, this app includes an audio option to read the text aloud and in multiple languages. The user can select their language of choice upon first use of the app or in the settings.</p>

			</br></br>
			<div class="one-thirds centered"><img src="img/imci/IMCI_Text-Options.png" alt="IMCI Text Options"></div>

			</br>

			<h3>Discussion Board</h3>
			<p>In current IMCI courses, students and instructors do not have effective means of communication outside of the classroom. Since this tablet application promotes independent learning and seeks to limit the role of the instructor and the classroom, we have established a discussion board that can be accessed via wireless services. Students and instructors can start discussion threads, to which all users can reply with additional posts. Such a tool is intended for general class communication as well as for peer-to-peer discussions about flagged exercises. By presenting this collaborative environment to the user upfront, a critical classroom discussion component can be readily individualized for the benefit of the student.</p>

			</br></br>
			<div class="one-thirds centered"><img src="img/imci/IMCI_Discussion-Board.png" alt="IMCI Discussion Board"></div>

			</br>

			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<p>The current method of instruction assumes that students already have the knowledge necessary to complete clinical case studies. In order to empower students to build up the preliminary knowledge and skills necessary to complete clinical case studies, our team and I recommend a <b>facilitated learning approach</b> which will require development of new educational content.</p>

			<p>The process would begin with presenting educational content followed by a series of question and answer assessments. After completing the initial set of exercises, the learning module would describe the relevant clinical classifications/diagnoses with examples of how to clinically assess the case(s). Finally, a case study would evaluate the student's ability to piece together the learned information and the clinical measures for treatment.</p>

			</br></br>
			<div class="three-thirds"><img src="img/imci/IMCI_Current-vs-Proposed.png" alt="IMCI Methods of Instruction"></div>
			</br>

			<p>We envision that doctors, researchers, and other educational stakeholders will collaborate to reconstruct the learning material and meet legal measures for publication. Ultimately, we hope that this material will integrate into our IMCI application to facilitate a more effective and holistic learning experience.</p>
