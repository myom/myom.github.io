			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>Timeshare owners at Wyndham Vacation Ownership (WVO) are mostly older, retired folk who use the online portal to search and book vacations and manage their accounts, among many other tasks. The existing consumer portal is outdated and often compels users to resort to the customer service line for support requests and inquiries.</p>
			<p>Thus, the client's ask was to deliver a complete optimization of WVO's consumer portal, producing an organized, informative, and effortless experience for timeshare owners.</p>

			</br>

			<h2>Team</h2>
			<p>Myself, another UX designer, VP of UX, account supervisor, producer, business analyst, 2 visual designers, 2 front-end developers.</p>

			</br>

			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>We underwent a waterfall process for ten 2-week-long design sprints, one for each major section of the site. Each week I participated in a handful of informal pow-wows, 2-3 internal meetings, and 1-2 client calls during which the team collectively strategized, brainstormed, presented, and/or critiqued designs to ensure alignment with the client's requirements and timeline.</p>
			<p>My tasks included:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Problem Exploration</u></br>Analyzing functional requirements, all sorts of esoteric business rules, and high-level user needs.</li>
					</br>
					<li><u>Information Architecture</u></br>Organizing, condensing, and hierarchizing data and requirements. Creating sitemaps and userflows.</li>
					</br>
					<li><u>Competitive Analysis</u></br>Examining best practices and common design patterns for particular features (e.g., results listings, filtering, sorting, map views, forms).</li>
					</br>
					<li><u>Interaction Design</u></br>Mapping out interaction models, process flows, and error studies. Translating IA into low-fidelity wireframes.</li>
					</br>
					<li><u>Functional Specifications</u></br>Documenting technical and business requirements for page elements and the user interaction. </li>
					</br>
					<li><u>Client Presentation</u></br>Structuring, creating, and annotating presentation decks.</li>	
				</ul>

						<h3>"No dead ends while searching for a vacation."</h3>

						<p>WVO's philosophy is that the customer should rarely reach a dead end while searching for a vacation. Achieving this was challenging considering that WVO's program-wide rules, resort-specific rules, and even the owner's membership type simultaneously determine eligibility for specific resorts, units, and date ranges.</p>

						<p>For example, a selected date range and room type may be valid for one resort but violates a booking requirement for another. But since we don't want to block the customer from viewing the invalid resort, our solution was to allow users to make a <i><b>Dateless Search</b>, from which they can view and compare availability for different room types across different date ranges.</i></p>
						
						</br>
						
						<h3>"How can we intuitively display availability for all the different room types?"</h3>

						<p>Initially, our team explored the option to view availability for all room types at a single resort at the same time. The user could scan a resort's calendar in order to determine their desired room on the desired date range. We ultimately concluded that this treatment would display too much information and confuse the user since it's not quite representative of the standard monthly calendar.</p>
						
						</br>
						<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar_Old.png" alt="All Rooms At Once"></div>
			
						<p>Subsequently, we proceeded with allowing the user to toggle through and view available dates for one room type at a time.</p>
						
						</br>
						<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar.png" alt="One Room At A Time"></div>
			
						<p>Shown here is an error state that captures the check-in day rule at this particular resort. I initially wanted to take a preventative approach and display this selected date (Sept. 16) as unavailable/unselectable. On hover, a message could indicate why exactly the room type is unavailable on this date. However, we were told that WVO's CMS wouldn't be able to display multiple error messages if such a case arises, so we adopted a responsive erroring approach on selection of a date.</p>
			
						</br>
						<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar2.png" alt="Responsive Erroring"></div>
			
						<p>On selection of a check-in date, the system narrows down booking restrictions and enforces the resort's maximum length of stay rule. Here, the resort allows stays up to 6 nights:</p>
			
						</br>
						<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar3.png" alt="Selected Check-In Date"></div>
			
						<p>On selection of valid check-in and check-out dates, the user can proceed to book the room, or if desired, run a new search with these dates. I felt that including the latter option could be useful, since users may come to determine their dates of travel in the process of using the availability calendar. If this becomes the case, the user may want to view other resorts with the selected date range in mind.</p>

						</br>
						<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar4.png" alt="Valid Dates Selected"></div>

						<p>Shown here is a state to view information about a specific room type. Initially, I designed it to load in place of the calendar so the user can toggle between and compare various room types. But since the nature of the information is auxiliary to the core experience of selecting dates, I modified the state to exist as an overlay instead.</p>

						</br>
						<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar5.png" alt="Unit Information"></div>

						<p>Shown below is the availability calendar in the context of the search results page.</p>

						<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Search_Results.png" alt="Availability Search Results"></div>

						</br>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

						<p>The biggest challenge of all was striving to create a simple experience while incorporating WVO's esoteric business rules. This required constant communication with the client's product owners and developers to ensure that we had a full grasp on the product requirements and technical feasibility.</p>

						<p>While some of the travel industry's beasts such as Kayak and AirBnB provided good insight into smart design patterns, a crucial lesson I learned is that best practices falter if the design does not align with the product's business model, especially given WVO's unique program rules and user needs.</p>

						<h3>"Explore what Wyndham has to offer."</h3>

						<p>The Explore Resorts experience allows owners to discover and learn about WVO's various resort offerings. Features include: search with filters, list + map results, and a compare tool.</p>

						<p>Given that this feature is intended more for exploring than it is for finding a specific resort, we figured that users would want to scout out and plan potential stays based on location (e.g., resort near Disney World). Thus, we opted for a dual list and map experience to encourage users to explore resorts visually--a la AirBnB, Yelp, Foursquare, etc.
						</p>

						<div class="center"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Explore_Results.png" alt="List + Map View"></div></div>

						<p>Filters were configured into three main categories: Location, Vacation Experience, and Special Needs.</p>

						</br>
						<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Explore_Filters.png" alt="Filters"></div>

						</br>
						<p>Below, I demonstrate sample content mapping to the elements for filtering by Location at different levels. Users are able to select a single location, and additional layers of specificity within a master location (e.g., USA, Canada, Caribbean) count as a single selection. </p>

						</br>
						<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Explore_Filters-Location.png" alt="Filters-Location"></div>

						</br>
						</br>
						<hr>
						</br>
						<h3>"Compare Wyndham's portfolio of resorts."</h3>						

						<p>To further the ability for owners to explore resorts, we created a modular compare tool that is accessible on the results page and launches as an overlay on select of 1-3 resorts to compare.</p>

						<p>Here, the user has only selected one resort to compare. The right rail includes a search for any resort by its name and three accordion-style tabs: (1) results from the existing Explore Resorts search, (2) resorts that the user has added to their wishlist, and (3) system-generated suggestions.</p>
						<div class="center"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Explore_Compare_1.png" alt="Compare One Resort"></div></div>

						<p>Here, the user has selected a second resort to compare.</p>
						<div class="center"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Explore_Compare_2.png" alt="Compare Two Resorts"></div></div>

						<p>Here, the user has selected a third and final resort to compare. One or more resorts must be removed for the right rail to appear.</p>
						<div class="center"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Explore_Compare_3.png" alt="Compare Three Resorts"></div></div>

						<p>Lastly, in this view, the user has removed all resorts from the compare tool.</p>
						<div class="center"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Explore_Compare_0.png" alt="Compare None"></div></div>	

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

						<p>While incorporating the Compare Tool into the Explore Resorts page, I was tempted to go all out with gaudy features. On the list/map view results page, I initially designed a "shopping cart" through which the user can preview which resorts they are about to compare, but once I took a step back to think about the overall user experience, I realized that honing in on specific features could detract from the main goal of this section--to explore resorts, not to compare resorts. And so I was challenged to strip out the excess and to simplify the compare selection process.</p>

						<h3>"Owner 101 - Learn how to make the most of your membership."</h3>

						<p>Traditionally, in a content-heavy area of a site, a content audit and strategy exercise would produce the findings necessary to drive the structure of the content. That is, <i>what are the categorizational elements that will make up the section and how will content live within this overall organization of information?</i></p>

						<p>The problem was that the client did not yet have their content defined. In lieu of this, our approach to Owner 101 was to develop templates that can accommodate for a variety of potential content types and for a standard IA based on our understandings of the client's content goals.</p>

						<p>In order to identify the necessary templates, we put together some variants of a sitemap for this section:
						</br></br>
						<b>Version 1</b>: organizes content (articles) at a single level.
							</br>
							<ul>
								<li>Each topic has its own page and all information/content related to that topic will exist in that page. This structure works best if Educational content is minimal, without frequent updates.</li>
								<li>Templates Required: Owner 101 Landing Page, Article Page, FAQ Page, Glossary</li>
								<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Owner101-Sitemap-V1.png" alt="Owner 101 Sitemap: V1" style="float: left"></div>
							</ul>
						</br>
						<b>Version 2A</b>: categorizes content into additional types.
							</br>
							<ul>
								<li>The meat of the content is divided into two different areas: Knowledge Base and Learning Center. The Knowledge Base contains the detailed/fact-sheet information-broken into articles, while the Learning Center houses the more conversational/inspirational/blog-like content, all living within a single page.</li>
								<li>Templates Required: Owner 101 Landing Page, Knowledge Base Page, Article Page, Learning Center Page, FAQ Page, Glossary</li>
								<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Owner101-Sitemap-V2A.png" alt="Owner 101 Sitemap: V2A"></div>
							</ul>
						</br>
						
						<b>Version 2B</b>: added another layer of categorization, best utilized for larger amounts of content.
							</br>
							<ul>
								<li>Here, "topics" act as an organizational facet, where the Knowledge Base houses a list of all topics, and articles are child pages of the Knowledge Base. The Learning Center is also broken into articles. Lastly, this variant incorporates a Video Library section, which contains all videos collected from the various articles in Owner 101.</li>
								<li>Templates Required: Owner 101 Landing Page, Knowledge Base Page, Learning Center Page, Article Page, FAQ Page, Glossary, Video Library</li>
								<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Owner101-Sitemap-V2B.png" alt="Owner 101 Sitemap: V2B"></div>
							</ul>
						</br>
						<b>Version 3</b>: accommodates for the same level and amount of content as V2B but slightly changes the presentation of the organization.
							</br>
							<ul>
								<li>Instead of having a separate Knowledge Base page, users will find all educational topics on the Owner 101 landing page. From here, they can dive into a specific topic landing page, which which will link them to all articles for that topic. This approach works well if topics will be broader and have many articles beneath them.</li>
								<li>Templates Required: Owner 101 Landing Page, Topic Page, Learning Center Page, Article Page, FAQ Page, Glossary, Video Library</li>
								<div class="center"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Owner101-Sitemap-V3.png" alt="Owner 101 Sitemap: V3"></div>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<hr>
						</br>

						<p>The client chose <b>Version 2B</b>, and so we wireframed out the associated templates while drawing insights from other knowledge base, help center, support, and FAQ pages (e.g., Basecamp, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, GoogleDrive, MailChimp, Pinterest, Sketch3, Spotify, Vimeo). Here are some templates below:</p>
					
						</br>
						<h2>Landing Page</h2>
						<div class="center"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Owner101-Landing.png" alt="Owner 101 Landing Page"></div></div>

						</br>
						<h2>Knowledge Base</h2>
						<div class="center"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Owner101-KnowledgeBase.png" alt="Owner 101 Knowledge Base"></div></div>

						</br>
						<h2>Knowledge Base: Article Page</h2>
						<div class="center"><div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Owner101-ArticlePage.png" alt="Owner 101 Article Page"></div></div>
