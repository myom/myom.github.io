			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>Timeshare owners at Wyndham Vacation Ownership (WVO) are mostly older, retired folk who use the online portal to search and book vacations, utilize points, and manage accounts, among many other tasks. The existing consumer portal is outdated and often leaves users to resort to its customer service line for support requests and inquiries.</p>
			<p>Thus, the client's ask was a complete optimization of WVO's consumer portal to produce an organized, educational, and effortless experience.</p>
			</br>

			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>The team consisted of myself, another UX designer, our VP of UX, an account supervisor, a producer, a business analyst, two visual designers, and two front-end developers. For each major section of the site, we underwent a two-week-long design sprint. Each week, we had 2-3 internal meetings and 1-2 client calls during which we strategized, brainstormed, and/or critiqued designs to ensure that we were aligned with the client's requirements and timeline.</p>
			<p>My tasks included:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Problem Exploration</u></br>Analyzing functional requirements, all sorts of esoteric business rules, and high-level user needs.</li>
					</br>
					<li><u>Information Architecture</u></br>Organizing data and requirements into spreadsheets/matrices. Developing sitemaps and userflows.</li>
					</br>
					<li><u>Competitive Analysis</u></br>Examining best practices and common design patterns for particular features (e.g., results listings, filtering, sorting, map views, forms).</li>
					</br>
					<li><u>Interaction Design</u></br>Mapping out interaction models, process flows, and error studies. Translating IA into low-fidelity wireframes.</li>
					</br>
					<li><u>Functional Specifications</u></br>Documenting technical and business requirements for page elements and the user interaction. </li>
					</br>
					<li><u>Client Presentation</u></br>Structuring, creating, and annotating presentation decks.</li>	
				</ul>

						<h3>"No dead ends when searching for a vacation."</h3>

						<p>WVO's philosophy is that the customer should rarely reach a dead end while searching for a vacation. Achieving this was challenging considering that WVO's program-wide rules, resort-specific rules, and even the owner's membership type all come into play to determine whether or not a specific resort and unit can be booked for a selected date range.</p>

						<p>For example, a date range selection may be valid for one resort but violates a minimum length of stay requirement for another resort. But since we don't want to block the customer from viewing that invalid resort, we configured the date selection logic to allow a Dateless Search--providing the user flexibility with dates, locations, and room types.</p>
			
						<p>Given the complexity of these booking requirements, I sifted through WVO resorts' rules and deduced three possible date-related error scenarios:
						<ol>
							<li>User selects a check-in date that violates resort's check-in day of week rule.</li>
							<li>User selects a check-out date that violates resort's check-out day of week rule.</li>
							<li>User selects a check-out date that does not meet resort's minimum/maximum length of stay rule.</li>
						</ol>
						</p>

						<p>These scenarios were used to form the framework to cover the bases for error handling, covered in a bit below.</p>
						
						</br>
						
						<h3>"How can we intuitively display the availability for all the different room types?"</h3>

						<p>Initially, our team explored the option to view availability for all room types at a single resort at the same time. The user could scan a resort's calendar in order to determine their desired room on the desired date range. We ultimately concluded that this treatment would display too much information and confuse the user since it's not quite representative of the standard monthly calendar.</p>
			
						<div class="center"><a href="img/wyndham-consumer/____.png" rel="lightbox" title="All Rooms At Once"><div class="thumbnail"><span>All Rooms At Once</span><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/____.png" alt="All Rooms At Once"></div></a></div>
			
						<p>Subsequently, we proceeded with allowing the user to toggle through and view available dates for one room type at a time.</p>
			
						<div class="center"><a href="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar.png" rel="lightbox" title="One Room At A Time"><div class="thumbnail"><span>One Room At A Time</span><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar.png" alt="One Room At A Time"></div></a></div>
			
						<p>Shown here is an error state that captures the check-in day rule at this particular resort. I initially wanted to take a preventative approach and display this selected date (Sept. 16) as unavailable from the start. On hover, a message could indicate why exactly the room type is unavailable on this date. However, we were told that WVO's CMS wouldn't be able to display multiple error messages if the case arises, and so we adopted a responsive erroring approach.</p>
			
						<div class="center"><a href="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar2.png" rel="lightbox" title="Responsive Erroring"><div class="thumbnail"><span>Responsive Erroring</span><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar2.png" alt="Responsive Erroring"></div></a></div>
			
						<p>But on selection of a check-in date, the system can narrow down booking restrictions considerably enough so as to load in the resort's maximum length of stay rule, as shown.</p>
			
						<div class="center"><a href="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar3.png" rel="lightbox" title="Maximum Length Of Stay"><div class="thumbnail"><span>Maximum Length Of Stay</span><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar3.png" alt="Maximum Length of Stay"></div></a></div>
			
						<p>On selection of valid check-in and check-out dates, the user can proceed to book the room, or if desired, run a new search with these dates. I felt that including the latter option could prove useful, since users may only be determining their dates of travel in the process of using the availability calendar. If this happens to be the case, the user may want to view other resorts with the selected date range in mind.</p>

						<div class="center"><a href="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar4.png" rel="lightbox" title="Valid Dates Selected"><div class="thumbnail"><span>Valid Dates Selected</span><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar4.png" alt="Valid Dates Selected"></div></a></div>

						<p>Shown here is a state to view information about a specific room type. Initially, I designed it to load in place of the calendar so the user can toggle between and compare various room types. But since the nature of the information is auxiliary to the core experience of selecting dates, I modified the state to exist in an overlay.</p>

						<div class="center"><a href="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar5.png" rel="lightbox" title="Unit Information"><div class="thumbnail"><span>Unit Information</span><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/Availability_Calendar5.png" alt="Unit Information"></div></a></div>

						</br>

						<p>Shown below is the availability calendar in the context of the search results page.</p>

						<div class="center"><a href="img/wyndham-consumer/Resort_Dateless_Search.png" rel="lightbox" title="Resort 	Availability Search"><div class="thumbnail"><span>Resort Availability Search</span><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/	Resort_Dateless_Search.png" alt="Resort Availability Search"></div></a></div>

						</br>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

						<p>The biggest challenge of all was striving to create a simple experience while incorporating WVO's esoteric business rules. This required constant communication with the client's product owners and developers to ensure that we had a full grasp on the product requirements and technical feasibility.</p>

						<p>While some of the travel industry's beasts such as Kayak and AirBnB provided good insight into smart design patterns, a crucial lesson I learned is that best practices falter if the design does not align with the product's business model, especially given WVO's unique program rules and user needs.</p>

						<h3>"Explore what WVO has to offer"</h3>

						<p>The Explore Resorts experience allows owners to discover and learn about WVO's various resort offerings. Features include: search with filters, list + map results, and a compare tool.</p>

						<p>This landing page acts as the entry point for users to search for resorts. Here, we designed the search widget to pre-filter resorts by Location, Vacation Experience (e.g., Beaches, Mountains, Metropolitan), and/or Special Needs. Additionally, the area below the search widget showcases thematic groupings of resorts for inspirational browsing.</p>

						<div class="center"><a href="img/wyndham-consumer/____.png" rel="lightbox" title="Landing Page"><div class="thumbnail"><span>Landing Page</span><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/____.png" alt="Landing Page"></div></a></div>

						<p>Given that this feature is intended more for exploring than it is for finding a specific resort, we figured that users would want to scout out and plan potential stays based on location (e.g., resort near Disney World). Thus, we opted for a dual list and map experience to encourage users to explore resorts visually--a la AirBnB, Yelp, Foursquare, etc.
						</p>

						<div class="center"><a href="img/wyndham-consumer/____.png" rel="lightbox" title="List + Map View"><div class="thumbnail"><span>List + Map View</span><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/____.png" alt="List + Map View"></div></a></div>

						<p>The map can be expanded full-width as well.</p>

						<div class="center"><a href="img/wyndham-consumer/____.png" rel="lightbox" title="Map View"><div class="thumbnail"><span>List + Map View</span><img src="img/wyndham-consumer/____.png" alt="Map View"></div></a></div>

						<p>Here, I "map out" the flow when a user takes the liberty of zooming out beyond the bounds of the existing filters (Florida, On-Site Beach, On-Site Golf) and attempts to search the new map area.</p>
